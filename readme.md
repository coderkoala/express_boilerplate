# StarMIS Microservice vBeta

A nodeJS(ExpressJS) microservice server that is an easy to use boilerplate for starting your projects in expressJS. Written and maintained by [@coderkoala](https://github.com/coderkoala)

# Generic Management Information System Microservice

##### Server ochestration

Server can easily be ochestrated with [pm2(Process Manager 2)](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) for nodeJS(v14^). To start the server, use the following command:

` pm2 start` Starts the server

`pm2 monit` Monitor your instance.

`pm2 delete <instance_id>` Use `pm2 monit` to fetch your `instance_id` so you can temporarily remove the server from running.

`pm2 restart` restarts the fork of the server.

##### Data fetch
You might want the server to fetch newly created agents info being synced with the microservice. In that case, you can run the npm script which does the rest for you:

```
npm run import
```

This will begin import. Might take a while, so please wait patiently until the script is done running. It fetches volume data in a batch of 5000 then bulk inserts it, updating already present agent with the updated data.

### Fresh Installation
Simply follow the following commands to initialize a fresh instance of the server.
```
git clone https://github.com/coderkoala/MIS www
cd www
npm install

```
The project has been initialized. Next, install sequelize CLI to perform migrations.

```
npm i sequelize-cli -g
```
This installs sequelize for you to initialize your database. Next, perform the migration.
```
sequelize-cli db:create
sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
Next, you'll need to fetch data from your Dynamics CRM 2015 online server. Setup your environment file with the require credentials. [Refer to an example here.](https://github.com/coderkoala/MIS/blob/master/.env.example))

After fetching data from upstream, you will need to install pm2 to deploy.

```
# globally install PM2
npm install pm2 -g

# check if installed properly
pm2 -V
```

Finally, start your server:
```
pm2 start
```
Refer to your pm2 environment configuration with your `ecosystem.config.js` file. It lists all parameters for the server to run.
